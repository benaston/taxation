#Taxation

##Types of Taxes

###Corporation Tax

 - **20%** paid on annual profits up to 300k.

###Income Tax

 - Â£9,440 tax free ("personal allowance" - "thank you" tax-man)
 - Upto 35k above personal allowance **20%*
 - 35k to 150k **40%**
 - 150k+ **45%**

###National Insurance

Massively complicated, but works out around **10%** per unit income/month.

###Dividend Tax

Depends on your overall income tax band:

---------------------
| upto 32,010 | **10%**
| 32,1010 to 150k | **32.5%**
| 150k+ | **37.5%**

###VAT

 - **13%** (but I bill at **20%** to cover the loss of the ability to reclaim the VAT for purchases under 2000 GBP)
 
This is added to my daily rate, and so does not impact my income.

It impacts expenditure, this can be optimised by ensuring purchases for the business over 2000 GBP are made through the business.
